WOZSound
========

Data of the mobile iPhone App called WOZSound that have arisen in the context of my master thesis.

The thesis was written at the Hochschule Fulda - University of Applied Sciences (Germany) in cooperation with the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen (Germany).

WOZSound is an application with which it is possible to play spezific sounds during a Wizard of Oz experiment with a finger tap.

Let me know if there are problems. I appreciate your feedback.
